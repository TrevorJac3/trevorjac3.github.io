      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Think about the last time you bought something or just read something online. Did you need anything to explain how to use the website? 
         Did everything go quick and smooth for you? Thatâ€™s what I can do, I make websites that look great and are so easy to use that people won't need instructions to use them.
         I can do this for a wide variety of things. In addition I can code video games and draw pixel art.]

      <h3>About my game</h3>
      <p>
        I have been developing a co-op zombie survival game for a year now. Though my progress has been slow, it still has great potential.
        I am not the best at animation so that has been the biggest stumbling block for me. dispite this the game so far has many essential features already done.
        These features are movement of the player as well as the camera staying focused on the player, collisions, transitioning to other rooms, dodge rolling, diolouge system,
        destructable objects and left behind particle effects, and melee attacks. The big inspiration behind the game is call of duty zombie series as well as undertale and final fantasy.
