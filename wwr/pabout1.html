            <h1>My name is Trevor Jacques, I am 18 and am from California. I am one of 3 children, the other two are my older sisters. I have two loving parents who inspire me to acheive my dreams.
            I one day hope to work as a software developer or a game developer. I grew up playing videogames, so my connection to technology started young.

            <h2>I have a couple other hobbies besides videogames. A thing I love to do and have been doing nearly my whole life is dirtbiking. My family has always gone to the deserts of California to ride dirtbikes.
                It is one of our favorite pass times.

            <h2>One of my newer hobbies is weightlifting. I started to get into working out and fitness during the second year of quarentine.
                It has been a great stress releaver and really helps me get through tough days.
